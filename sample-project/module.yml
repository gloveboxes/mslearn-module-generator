summary: Deploy an Azure Sphere application to monitor ambient conditions for a laboratory. The application will monitor the room environment, connect to Azure IoT Central, and send telemetry data from the device to the cloud. You'll control cloud-to-device communications and undertake actions as needed.

abstract: |
  In this module, you will:
  - Create an Azure IoT Central application
  - Configure your Azure Sphere application to Azure IoT Central
  - Build and deploy the Azure Sphere application
  - Display environment telemetry in the Azure IoT Central dashboard
  - Control an Azure Sphere application by using Azure IoT Central properties and commands
  - Deploy a new more sensitive room sensor onto an Azure Sphere real-time core running Azure RTOS
  - Read the data from the new sensor running on the real-time core and send the data to IoT Central
